This is the GRBL edited for **RishaLaser** used as plotter xy.

The configuration is done to use with a FabScan shield:

(developed to be used with FabScan opensource 3d scanner : http://hci.rwth-aachen.de/fabscan)

The servo that drives the marker/pen is driven by an ATtiny45 connected to pin D12.

Based on the GRBL v0.8c
